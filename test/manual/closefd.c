// gcc -g test/manual/closefd.c -o closefd && ./closefd

/* This test was written because we've observed processes (splunk maybe)
   that close all file descriptors during initialization, probably to
   avoid leaking file descritors during subsequent fork/exec sequences.

   So, it's possible that the file descriptors for  g_mtc, g_log, and
   g_ctl can get closed out from under the libscope.so library.

   This was written to help verify that we correctly detect that our
   file descriptor was closed (errno of EBADF), and that we reestablish
   the connection.  Its a process that closes file descriptors that it
   didn't open.

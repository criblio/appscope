# Running AppScope in Edge Mode on a Host

"Edge Mode" means "driving" AppScope from Cribl Edge. This topic walks you through a setup procedure, and then through the two basic AppScope techniques:

1. **Scope by PID** â€“ Instrumenting one process on one host.
1. **Scope by Rule** â€“ Instrumenting multiple processes on an entire Edge Fleet.

We assume that you have an Edge Leader running in Cribl.Cloud, and that you want to add a new Edge Node to its Fleet, and to scope processes running on the new Edge Node.

You can easily modify these instructions to add more than one Edge Node and then use Scope by Rules to scope processes on the entire Fleet.

## Setup

In Cribl.Cloud:

1. Click **Manage Edge**.
2. Select the Fleet (`default_fleet` in my case) where youâ€™ll be adding a Linux host.
3. From the **Add/Update Edge Node** drop-down, select **Linux** > **Add** to open the **Add Linux Node** modal.
4. Click **Copy script** and dismiss the modal.
- Note: Several parameters provided on this modal can alter the contents of the script. Defaults are fine for this example.
5. Note the value of **Edge Nodes** at upper left.

On the Linux host we want to observe with Edge:

1. Open a shell. 
2. Paste the script into the shell, and edit it to run it as root:
- Add `sudo` to the bash command at the end of the script. For example, this â€¦  
`curl 'https://...%2Fcribl' | bash -` 
- â€¦ becomes this: 
`curl 'https://... %2Fcribl' | sudo bash - `
3. Execute the script.

Give it a minute ðŸ™‚ 

Return to Cribl.Cloud UI to verify that the new Node is present:

1.  The value of **Edge Nodes** should have increased by 1.
2. Select **List View** (and filtering by host if needed) â€“ the new Edge Node should appear in the list.  

At this point, Edge is installed on a Linux container in its default location (`/opt/cribl`), is running, and is connected to the Edge Leader.  

## Scope by PID

Still in Edgeâ€™s **List View** tab:

- Click the GUID for the host weâ€™ve just added.
- Click the count of **running processes** at upper left. Now you can observe and interact with a list of processes on this particular Linux Host.

On the Linux host: 

- In a shell, start a process you want to scope.  For this example, letâ€™s start `top`.  

Back in Edge: 

Within seconds, `top` should appear in the process list. (If you donâ€™t see it, try filtering by Command.) At this point `top` is running but is not yet instrumented by AppScope.

1. Select the `top` command's row to open the **Process: top** drawer.
2. In the **AppScope** tab, select the AppScope **Configuration** we want to use for this process. 
- Start with `A sensible AppScope configuration ...` .  
3. Leave the default **Source **as `in_appscope`.** **
- If you use a different AppScope Source, configure that Source to set **General Settings** > **Optional Settings** > **UNIX socket permissions** to `777`
4. Click **Start monitoring**.  
- Give it a minute ðŸ™‚ 
- You should see green checkmarks in all the Status columns.

Thatâ€™s it!  You just scoped your first process!

Now youâ€™ll want to confirm that Edge is receiving AppScope data for the scoped `top` process.

On the Edge Leader:

- Navigate to **More** > **Sources** and select **AppScope** to open the source page. 
- In the row where `ID` is `in_appscope`: 
- The Source should be enabled.
- Socket should be set to `$CRIBL_HOME/state/appscope.sock`.  
- In the Status column, click **Live**, and you should now see events flowing!  Yeah!

## Scope by Rule

On the Linux host: 

- In your shell, start a process you want to scope.  Again, letâ€™s  run `top`.  

On the Edge Leader:

- Navigate to **More** > **Sources** and select **AppScope** to open the Source page. 
- Select the row where `ID` is `in_appscope` .

In the AppScope Rules tab, under Rules, click **Add Rule** and complete the Rule as follows:

- **Process name**: `top`
- **Process argument**: Skip, because Process name and Process argument are mutually exclusive.
- **AppScope config**: Select the  `A sensible AppScope configuration ...` .  

Click **Save**.

Click **Commit**, provide a commit message, and click **Commit and Deploy**.

Wait for the changes to be deployed to the Edge Node â€“ probably around 30 seconds. 

- Click the **Live Data tab**, and you should now see events flowing!  Yeah! â€¦ but wait â€“Â thereâ€™s more â€¦

Back on the Linux host:

- In your shell, start *another* `top` process to prove that any process matching your Rule gets scoped.
- Click the **Live Data tab**, and you should now see events flowing from two `top` processes â€“Â theyâ€™ll have different PIDs.

This gets to whatâ€™s so powerful about Rules: You can start processes *after* setting things up, and they get scoped.

Now return to Edgeâ€™s **List View** tab â€“Â the **AppScope** column should indicate that both `top` processes are being scoped.

Optionally, you can try the other two configurations and see how the scoped data changes. For the config that has payloads enabled, `curl` and `wget` are good choices.

In real life, this would be the moment to consider creating Routes and Pipelines in Cribl Edge, to send AppScope data to your favorite Destination(s).

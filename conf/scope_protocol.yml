# Cribl AppScope - Protocol Detector Configs
#
# Entries in this list define protocols that AppScope should detect in
# payloads and how to handle matches. The first packet seen on a channel is
# checked against the regular expression in each entry in the order they appear
# in this file. When one matches, later entries are skipped.
#
# Entries have the following properties:
#
#   name     String protocol name used in protocol-detect events and payload
#            headers sent to LogStream (required)
#   regex    The regular expression to use (required)
#   binary   Boolean indicating whether the regex should be applied to a
#            hex-string version of the payload instead of the binary payload
#            (default: false)
#   detect   Boolean indicating whether protocol-detect events should be
#            generated (default: true)
#   payload  Boolean indicating whether payload-processing should be enabled
#            for matching streams (default: false)
#
# When payloads are enabled globally, the payload options here are ignored.
#
# Warning: The name is currently inserted into the JSON header for payloads
# sent to LogStream so it cannot contain double quotes or back-slashes without
# breaking the JSON. It needs to be kept fairly short too so the header doesn't
# exceed the 1k limit. If this becomes a problem, we'll consider adding logging
# and validation.

protocol:


# Example detector for the plain-text Redis protocol using the default detect
# and payload settings
#
#    - name: Redis
#      regex: "^[*]\\d+|^[+]\\w+|^[$]\\d+"


# Example detector for the MongoDB protocol showing how to detect a binary
# protocol
#
#    - name: Mongo
#      regex: "^240100000000000000000000d407"
#      binary: true
#      len: 14


# AppScope uses an internally defined protocol detector for HTTP like the
# example below automatically when the LogStream backend is enabled.
#
# Uncomment this and adjust as needed to override the defaults or to enable
# HTTP detection when not using LogStream.
#
#    - name: HTTP
#      regex: " HTTP\\/1\\.[0-2]|PRI \\* HTTP\\/2\\.0\r\n\r\nSM\r\n\r\n"
#      detect: true
#      payload: true


# AppScope uses another internally defined protocol detector for TLS like the
# example below by default.
#
# Uncomment this entry to override the regex details or to set detect to false.
# The payload setting here is never used. AppScope never sends encrypted
# payloads to disk and only sends payloads to LogSteam during TLS negotiation.
#
#    - name: TLS
#      regex: "^16030[0-3].{4}0[12]"
#      binary: true
#      len: 6

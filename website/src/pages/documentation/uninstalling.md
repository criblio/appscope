## Uninstalling
----

You can uninstall AppScope by simply deleting the binary:

```
rm -rf scope
```

… and the associated history directory:

```
cd ~
rm -rf ./scope
```
</br>

Currently scope’d applications will continue to run. To remove the AppScope library from a running process, you will need to restart that process.

# AppScope - Developer Docs

Since most AppScope users are developers, it's not so useful to think of "developer docs" versus "user docs."

Instead, we have:

- The main [README](../README.md) at the top level of this project (which you should have already read).
- The [AppScope docs](https://appscope.dev/docs/) on the website, which cover AppScope concepts and operation. These docs includes release notes, how-to's, and examples, and are built from the [website/](./website/) content in this repo.
- The docs in the present directory, which cover topics essential for developers thinking about contributing to the project:
  - The AppScope [release process](./RELEASE.md) - Branches, tags, workflows, and so on.
  - The [startup logic](./STARTUP.md) for how we get the library loaded.

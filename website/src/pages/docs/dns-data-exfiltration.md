title: Detecting DNS Data Exfiltration
---

## Introduction DNS

DNS (Domain Name System) is a fundamental internet protocol responsible for translating domain names into IP addresses. DNS is intended to take on the role of a phone book for the internet; therefore, it is a universally used and trusted worldwide protocol. DNS uses port 53, which is almost always open on systems and are not be blocked to prevent DNS traffic from firewalls. Many organizations do not decide to monitor DNS traffic for malicious activity. The lack of monitoring and restrictions of the DNS protocol is the reason why attackers often abuse DNS as a way of performing cyberattacks against victim machines. This oversight can have dramatic consequences.

Here is the overview of the attack vector using DNS :

Examples of these attacks are:

- DNS data exfiltration: This involves transmitting sensitive or unauthorized data from a compromised network to an external destination using DNS queries and responses. For example, we can break up a large amount of sensitive data, encrypt it, split it into small chunks, send it through DNS, and reassemble it on the other side.
- DNS tunneling to establish C2 (command and control): This allows attackers to bypass network security restrictions and establish a channel for command and control between two endpoints using DNS traffic.

There are several [methods](
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36904959/) that can be employed to detect DNS annomalies.

This post will show how AppScope can detect DNS anomalies and send a notification using a Slack channel.

### Prerequisites

You will need:
- Create a Slack application with an API token (Bot) using [Slack API](https://api.slack.com/start/quickstart)
- the API token should have following scope [`chat_write`](https://api.slack.com/scopes/chat:write), [`chart_write_public`](https://api.slack.com/scopes/chat:write.public) to allow push notifications
- Retrieve the channel id where bot should post the notifications
- Deploy the Slack application

### Investigating the DNS data

Here is the overview of the solution:

#### Setting Up the AppScope configuration

Here is the example content of AppScope configuration file `SCOPE_CONFIGURATION_FILE` which will be used in this example:

```yml
metric:
  enable: false
event:
  enable: true
  format:
    type: ndjson
    maxeventpersec: 10000
    enhancefs: false
  watch:
    - type: dns
      name: .*
      field: .*
      value: .*
  transport:
    type: tcp
    host: 127.0.0.1
    port: 9999
    tls:
      enable: false
cribl:
  enable: false
```

As you can see we intend to scope `dns` events and send data to `127.0.0.1:9999` using TCP.

#### Scope the application

The below command allows us to run and scope a specific application `APP_TO_SCOPE` with the `SCOPE_CONFIGURATION_FILE` defined above

```bash
scope run --userconfig <SCOPE_CONFIGURATION_FILE> -- <APP_TO_SCOPE>
```
#### Start the listener

The command below allows you to start the Scope listener/Slack sender, which enables you to:

- Listen for AppScope event data on `127.0.0.1:9999`.
- Process the DNS events to identify potential vulnerabilities in DNS requests/responses.
- Send notifications to Slack using the API token `SLAC_API_TOKEN` to a specific `CHANNEL_ID`.

```bash
scope listener --addr 127.0.0.1:9999 --notifytoken <SLAC_API_TOKEN> --channelid <CHANNEL_ID>
```

To determine suspicious DNS activity, the 'scope listener' looks in DNS queries/responses for the following:

- Unexpectedly long domain names
- Unexpected characters in domain names (non-ASCII and capital letters)
- Unexpectedly high Shannon Entropy value of specific domains

#### Demo
Here is the example detection of DNS tunneling which is used by [iodine](https://code.kryo.se/iodine/) project

#### Example notification

Here is the overview of example alert notification which can be seen in Slack:

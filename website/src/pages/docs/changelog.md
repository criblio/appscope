## AppScope 1.0.4

2022-05-10 - Maintenance Release

Assets are available via Docker and the Cribl CDN at the links below.

- `Docker`: `cribl/scope:1.0.4`
- `x86`: [https://cdn.cribl.io/dl/scope/1.0.4/linux/x86_64/scope](https://cdn.cribl.io/dl/scope/1.0.4/linux/x86_64/scope)
- `ARM`: [https://cdn.cribl.io/dl/scope/1.0.4/linux/aarch64/scope](https://cdn.cribl.io/dl/scope/1.0.4/linux/aarch64/scope)

### Fixes

AppScope 1.0.4 aims to resolve reported connectivity issues.

- [#896](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/issues/896) AppScope now creates a connection dedicated to transmitting payload data only if payloads are enabled.
- [#665](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/issues/665) AppScope now has safeguards to ensure that AppScope does not interfere with scoped processes exiting.
- [#869](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/issues/869) AppScope now uses an improved algorithm for omitting raw binary data from console events. The improved algorithm is better able to handle commands that switch back and forth between outputting text and outputting raw binary data to the console.

## AppScope 1.0.3

2022-04-12 - Maintenance Release

Assets are available via Docker and the Cribl CDN at the links below.

- `Docker`: `cribl/scope:1.0.3`
- `x86`: [https://cdn.cribl.io/dl/scope/1.0.3/linux/x86_64/scope](https://cdn.cribl.io/dl/scope/1.0.3/linux/x86_64/scope)
- `ARM`: [https://cdn.cribl.io/dl/scope/1.0.3/linux/aarch64/scope](https://cdn.cribl.io/dl/scope/1.0.3/linux/aarch64/scope)

### Fixes

AppScope 1.0.3 improves the quality of results when scoping Go executables:

- [#738](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/issues/738) When scoping Go executables, AppScope is now able to produce events from two more Go functions: `unlinkat` and `getdents`. AppScope already had the ability to interpose the equivalent system calls in C (`unlink`, `unlinkat`, `readdir`).
- [#864](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/issues/864) When scoping Go executables that call the `openat` function, AppScope no longer fails to collect `fs.open` events. This brings AppScope up to date with changes to `openat` in recent versions of Go.
- [#862](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/issues/862) When scoping dynamic Go executables, AppScope no longer falsely logs nonexistent errors.

## AppScope 1.0.2

2022-03-15 - Maintenance Release

Assets are available via Docker and the Cribl CDN at the links below.

- `Docker`: `cribl/scope:1.0.2`
- `x86`: [https://cdn.cribl.io/dl/scope/1.0.2/linux/x86_64/scope](https://cdn.cribl.io/dl/scope/1.0.2/linux/x86_64/scope)
- `ARM`: [https://cdn.cribl.io/dl/scope/1.0.2/linux/aarch64/scope](https://cdn.cribl.io/dl/scope/1.0.2/linux/aarch64/scope)

### New Features and Improvements

AppScope 1.0.2 introduces fine-grained control of `scope events` output:

- [#826](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/issues/826) When you do filtering or matching with `scope events`, AppScope now shows **all** results by default. (The filtering/matching options are `--sort`, `--match`, `--source`, and `--sourcetype`.) Alternatively, you can limit the number of events with the `--last` option, e.g., `scope events --last 20`.
  - When you are **not** filtering or matching, `scope events` shows the last 20 results by default. Use `--last` to specify a different limit, or `--all` to see all results.
- [#20](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/issues/20) You can now specify one or more field names, with `scope events --fields`, and the output will show only those field names and their values alongside each event. (If you want to restrict output to only those events which **contain** the selected fields, add the `--match` option.)
- [#813](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/issues/813) You can use the `--sort` option to sort by a top-level field (i.e., a top-level element of the event body). By default, this returns events sorted in descending order, both for numeric values (such as timestamps) and string values (such as the values for the `proc` field). To sort in ascending order, add the `--reverse` flag.

Another usability improvement applies to the CLI as a whole:

- [#611](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/issues/611) Given combinations of arguments that don't make sense, `scope` now responds with an error.

### Fixes

- [#825](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/issues/825) Output of `scope events` is now rendered on one line.
- [#728](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/issues/728) Added more check (`_chk`) functions to `libscope.so`, without which a scoped command could fail when that command had been compiled with a particular GCC toolchain.
- [#787](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/issues/787) Through improved HTTP pipelining support, AppScope now avoids some cases where the `http_method` field in HTTP events contained junk. This work continues in [#829](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/issues/829).
- [#800](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/issues/800) AppScope now checks for conditions which caused Java applications to crash when scoped, and avoids the crashes by applying fallback behaviors where necessary.

## AppScope 1.0.1

2022-02-28 - Update to GA Release 

Assets are available via Docker and the Cribl CDN at the links below.

- `Docker`: `cribl/scope:1.0.1`
- `x86`: [https://cdn.cribl.io/dl/scope/1.0.1/linux/x86_64/scope](https://cdn.cribl.io/dl/scope/1.0.1/linux/x86_64/scope)
- `ARM`: [https://cdn.cribl.io/dl/scope/1.0.1/linux/aarch64/scope](https://cdn.cribl.io/dl/scope/1.0.1/linux/aarch64/scope)

#### Events and Metrics

- [#644](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/issues/644) Application-specific metrics can be captured.
- [#725](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/issues/725) Metrics and events are now [defined](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/tree/master/docs/schemas) in JSON Schema.
- [#723](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/issues/723) Metrics and events are now standardized. (Summary [here](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/issues/712#issuecomment-1030234850).)
- [#699](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/issues/699) Added an option to enable events via configuration file entries.
- [#402](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/issues/402) Added support for readdir to `fs` events.
- [#709](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/issues/709) Added support for unlinks / file removals to `fs` events.
- [#162](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/issues/162) Added `net.open` and `net.close` metrics.

#### Data Routing

- [#697](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/issues/697) Transport defaults and priorities have changed. (Summary [here](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/issues/712#issuecomment-1030234850).) 
- [#661](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/issues/661) The process uid and gid are now present in the `cribl` connection header.
- [#670](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/issues/670), [#700](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/issues/700), [#707](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/issues/707)  Added an `edge` transport type, with its own default search path and CLI support.
- [#571](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/issues/571) Added support for a `unix://` destination in the CLI.

### Fixes

- [#640](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/issues/640) An error message is now generated when AppScope can't attach to a static executable.
- [#677](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/issues/677), [#687](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/issues/687) Fixed HTTP header extraction.
- [#737](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/issues/737) Fixed a seg fault on a busy Jenkins.
- [#232](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/issues/232) Fixed HTTP metric aggregation.
- [#657](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/issues/657) `apt-get` no longer hangs.

## AppScope 0.8.1

2021-12-21 - Maintenance Pre-Release

- **Improvement**: [#533](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/issues/533) AppScope logs now include dropped message and connection failure indicators, which make it easier to diagnose TCP/TLS connection issues, or to see when no data is flowing from a scoped process.

- **Improvement**: [#534](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/issues/534) AppScope log entries now include timestamps, e.g., `[2021-10-20 17:48:36.974]`. This timestamp format is ambiguous, and a fix is planned for AppScope 1.0.0. See [#678](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/issues/678). 

- **Improvement**: [#229](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/issues/229) When a process starts, the User Identifier (UID) and Group Identifier (GID) now appear in AppScope's `proc.start` metric and process start event (also known as TCP JSON connection header).

- **Fix**: [#650](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/issues/650) When scoping a process with TLS, and that process does not last long enough for AppScope to complete the TLS connection, AppScope no longer causes the scoped process to crash.

## AppScope 0.8.0

2021-10-26 - Maintenance Pre-Release

- **Improvement**: [#543](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/issues/543) HTTP events are now all processed by the `libscope.so` library, not LogStream as was the case [previously](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/issues/311).

- **Improvement**: [#572](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/issues/572) The CLI now supports invoking a configuration file, using the syntax `scope run -u scope.yml -- foo` where `scope.yml` is the configuration file and `foo` is the command being scoped.

- **Improvement**: [#241](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/issues/241),[#271](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/issues/271),[#379](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/issues/379) The ARM64 limitations described in [#241](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/issues/241) are resolved and no longer apply, except that Go executables remain unsupported on ARM64.


- **Fix**: [#598](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/issues/598) Attempting to scope an executable that is Go version 1.17 or newer no longer causes AppScope to crash. AppScope does not support Go 1.17 yet, but now recognizes these executables and displays an informative message. 

- **Fix**: [#481](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/issues/481),[#575](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/issues/575) With musl libc-based distros, previous limitations on filesystem write events are now resolved, and no longer apply.

- **Fix**: [#397](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/issues/397),[#403](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/issues/403),[#567](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/issues/567),[#586](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/issues/586) With musl libc-based distros and Java, previous limitations on `scope attach` are now resolved and no longer apply.


## AppScope 0.7.5

2021-10-05 - Maintenance Pre-Release

- **Improvement**: [#462](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/issues/462), [#540](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/issues/540) Add support for sending event/metric output to a Unix domain socket.

- **Improvement**: [#492](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/issues/492) Add support for custom configuration with new `custom` section in `scope.yml`.  

- **Improvement**: [#489](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/issues/489) Streamline configuration file structure by eliminating `scope_protocol.yml` and merging its content into `scope.yml`.

- **Improvement**: [#503](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/issues/503) Promote the `tags` section of `scope.yml` to top level, removing it from the `metric` > `format` section. This change is **not** backwards-compatible. 

## AppScope 0.7.4

2021-09-14 - Maintenance Pre-Release

- **Fix**: [#264](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/issues/264),[#525](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/issues/525) `scope k8s` now (1) supports specifying the namespace to install into, and (2) when the [ConfigMap](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/configmap/) in that namespace is edited, automatically propagates the changes to all namespaces instrumented with the label `scope=enabled`.

## AppScope 0.7.3

2021-09-01 - Maintenance/Hotfix Pre-Release

- **Fix**: [#516](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/issues/516) Where scope'd processes use TLS, child processes no longer get stuck in fork calls.

- **Fix**: [#442](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/issues/442)
 Remove TLS exit handling code that is no longer needed.

- **Fix**: [#518](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/issues/518)
 Fix a build caching issue.

## AppScope 0.7.2

2021-08-17 - Maintenance Pre-Release

- **Improvement**: [#241](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/issues/241) Add experimental support for ARM64 architecture, with [limitations](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/issues/241#issuecomment-824428842).

- **Improvement**: [#401](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/issues/401) When `scope` attaches to a bash process, it now emits events for any child processes.

- **Improvement**: [#395](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/issues/395) Add a new environment variable, `SCOPE_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_SECS`, to configure wait behavior. This prevents events and metrics from being dropped when a scoped command exits quickly while using a connection with network latency.

- **Improvement**: [#311](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/issues/311) AppScope can now stream HTTP payloads to LogStream, whether the payloads originate as HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2 traffic. LogStream then converts the payloads to HTTP events.

- **Fix**: [#407](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/issues/407) To prevent errors, `scope prune` now rejects negative numbers as arguments. Positive arguments implicitly mean "how many sessions back" to delete or keep.

- **Fix**: [#416](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/issues/416) Ensure that file descriptors opened by libscope are not closed by SSH, to avoid scenarios where processes operating over network connections can get stuck at 100% CPU utilization.

- **Fix**: [#417](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/issues/417) Ensure that AppScope performs exit handling only after SSL is finished. This avoids double free errors where the OpenSSL exit handler, being called while TLS is not enabled, frees memory that was not allocated.

- **Fix**: [#327](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/issues/327) Protocol-detect events now use the `net` event type, which prevents them from being dropped by periodic threads.

This pre-release addresses the following issues:

## AppScope 0.7.1

2021-07-20 - Maintenance Pre-Release

This pre-release addresses the following issues:

- **Improvement**: [#363](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/pull/363) Add a new `scope ps` command to report on all processes into which the libscope library is loaded.
- **Improvement**: [#363](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/pull/363) Add support for attaching to a process by name (preserving existing attach by PID functionality), for example: `scope attach NAME`.
- **Improvement**: [#304](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/issues/304) Add support for configuring an `authToken` to pass to LogStream as a header, using `scope run -a ${authToken}` in the CLI, or the `cribl` section of `scope.yml`.
- **Improvement**: [#368](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/issues/368) Add the new `-n` or `--nobreaker` option for configuring LogStream breaker behavior from AppScope. This option prevents LogStream from running Event Breakers on an AppScope Source. The `--nobreaker` option can only be used with LogStream starting with version 3.0.4.
- **Improvement**: [#359](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/pull/359) Users who run scope as root now see the message `WARNING: Session history will be stored in $HOME/.scope/history and owned by root`.
- **Improvement**: [#278](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/pull/278) Integration tests are now enabled for PRs to the `master` and `release/*` branches.
- **Improvement**: [#381](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/pull/381) Commits to master now redeploy the website only when there are changes in the `website/` content.
- **Improvement**: [#350](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/issues/350) In `docker-build`, add support for:
  - Overriding the `build` command, for example: `make docker-build CMD="make coreall"`.
  - Passing `-u $(id -u):$(id -g)` to Docker so that the current user owns build results.
  - Using `.dockerignore` to omit unnecessary and potentially large items like `**/core`, `website/`, `test/testContainers`.

- **Fix**: [#364](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/issues/364) Improved AppScope's delivery of pending events to a TLS server, upon process exit.
- **Fix**: [#394](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/pull/394) Improved AppScope's regex for determining whether a given filename represents a log file.
- **Fix**: [#309](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/issues/309) The `scope flows` command now works when `stdin` is a pipe.
- **Fix**: [#388](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/issues/388) Ensure that all dimension names contain underscores (`_`) rather than periods (`.`). The `http.status` and `http.target` dimensions have been corrected. This change is not backwards-compatible.
- **Fix**: [#393](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/pull/393) The metrics `http.client.duration` and `http.server.duration` are now the correct type, `timer`. This change is not backwards-compatible.
- **Fix**: [#358](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/pull/358) Cleaned up help for `-d` and `-k` options to `scope prune`.

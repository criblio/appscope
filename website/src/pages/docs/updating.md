# Updating

You can update AppScope in place. First, download a fresh version of the binary. (This example assumes that you are running AppScope from `/opt/appscope`, as described [here](/docs/downloading#where-from). If you're running AppScope from a different location, adapt the command accordingly.) 

```
curl -Lo /opt/appscope https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/io.cribl.cdn/dl/scope/cli/linux/scope && chmod 755 /opt/appscope
```

Then, to confirm the overwrite, verify AppScope's version and build date:

```
scope version
```

## Updating from Pre-Release Versions

You can skip this section unless you are updating a Maintenance Pre-Release (version 0.8.1 or older) to version 1.0 or newer.

**Note**: By "version 1.0," we mean version 1.0.1 or newer. The AppScope team recommends using a version above 1.0.0, which contained an incomplete feature set.

Changes in AppScope 1.0 affect some metric and event definitions, environment variables, and content (including default settings) in the `scope.yml` config file.

To update a Maintenance Pre-Release (version 0.8.1 or older) to version 1.0, follow this general procedure:

* Familiarize yourself with the [summary of changes](#summary-of-changes) below.

* If you use a config file, [download](https://github.com/criblio/appscope/blob/master/conf/scope.yml) the new config file from github, and read through it. 

* Make a note of changes that affect anything on which your deployment depends, including:
  * Defaults that have changed.
  * Metrics or events whose structure or names have changed.
  * Environment variables that you use outside of the config file, that need to be used differently than before.

* Based on what you discover:
  * Update how you (plan to) use environment variables.
  * Edit the new config file (if you are using one).
  * Configure any destinations to which you're sending data from AppScope, or scripts that operate on the data, to work with the changed event and/or metrics.

Then, go ahead and update!

### Summary of Changes in AppScope 1.0

This overview of changes should help you prepare to update AppScope.

#### Changes to Routing 

New routing capabilities in AppScope 1.0 required the following changes: 

- The `cribl` backend is now enabled by default, and its transport type now defaults to `edge` instead of `tcp`.
- A new environment variable, `SCOPE_CRIBL_ENABLE`, determines whether or not to send data to the `cribl` backend.
- When `SCOPE_CRIBL_ENABLE` is set to `false`, the default destination for the `ldscope` binary is `tcp`, as before.
- `SCOPE_CRIBL` or `SCOPE_CRIBL_CLOUD` now only define the `cribl` transport and destination.
- When the `edge` transport is used, `ldscope` and `scope` will search for a unix domain socket. The search tries the following locations, in order, only searching until a socket is found:  
  - `/var/run/appscope/appscope.sock`
  - `$CRIBL_HOME/state/appscope.sock`
  - `/opt/cribl/state/appscope.sock`
- In the CLI, the `-m` or `--metricdest`, `-e` or `--eventdest`, and `-c` or `--cribldest` options all enable you to target either `edge`, `unix`, or `tcp`.
  - As before, the default destination for the CLI is the `scope` session directory in the local filesystem.

Learn more about routing [here](/docs/data-routing).

#### Changes to Events and Metrics

AppScope events and metrics are now rigorously defined in schemas found in `/docs/schemas/`. Metrics and events follow more consistent patterns overall. Changes that resolve inconsistencies include:

- All metric types and units are consistent.
- All durations are in milliseconds unless explicitly defined otherwise.
- Non-aggregated metrics no longer appear alongside aggregated metrics.
- All summarized metrics now have `class: summary`.
- Event dimension names are consistent, e.g., `file_name` is now `file`.
- `id` and `_channel` fields have been added, where previously missing.

- The data fields `net_peer_port` and `net_host_port` are now of type `integer`, for example:

```
{"type":"evt","id":"vm-curl-curl wttr.in","_channel":"118389477035177","body":{"sourcetype":"http","_time":1643997015.8988931,"source":"http.req","host":"vm","proc":"curl","cmd":"curl wttr.in","pid":112157,"data":{"http_method":"GET","http_target":"/","http_flavor":"1.1","http_scheme":"http","http_host":"wttr.in","http_user_agent":"curl/7.74.0","net_transport":"IP.TCP","net_peer_ip":"5.9.243.187","net_peer_port":80,"net_host_ip":"10.0.2.15","net_host_port":44214}}}
```

- The data field `http_status_code` used to be a string for HTTP/2 traffic. It is now an integer for both HTTP/1 and HTTP/2 traffic. For example:

```
`{"type":"evt","id":"vm-curl- --http2 -I https://nghttp2.org/","_channel":"118695329693352","body":{"sourcetype":"http","_time":1643997322.1907151,"source":"http.resp","host":"vm","proc":"curl","cmd":"curl --http2 -I https://nghttp2.org/","pid":112210,"data":{"http_flavor":"2.0","http_stream":1,"http_status_code":200,"http_status_text":"OK","http_response_content_length":6616,"net_transport":"IP.TCP","net_peer_ip":"139.162.123.134","net_host_ip":"10.0.2.15","net_peer_port":443,"net_host_port":35352,"http_client_duration":186,"http_host":"nghttp2.org","http_method":"HEAD","http_target":"/","http_user_agent":"curl/7.74.0‚Äù}}}`
```

Review the tables below to determine whether event or metric name changes affect your use of AppScope.  (AppScope 1.0.0 has been omitted from the tables because it has been replaced by AppScope 1.0.1.)

# Using AppScope & Cribl Edge in a Container

**Assumptions**

- You have an Edge Leader running in Cribl.Cloud.
- You want to add a new Edge Node to its Fleet, and that Edge Node will be in a Docker container.
- You want to scope processes running on the host where the new Edge Nodeâ€™s Docker container resides. 
- You can even scope processes that run on other containers you run on that host.
- If you want to get fancy, you can add more than one Edge Node and then use Scope by Rules to scope processes on the entire Fleet.

### Overview

Hereâ€™s what youâ€™ll do in this walkthrough:

1. Set up the new Edge Node.
2. Scope by PID â€“Â this instruments one process on one host.
3. Scope by Rule â€“ this can instrument multiple processes on an entire Edge Fleet.

### Setup

In Cribl.Cloud:

1. Click **Manage Edge**.
2. Select the Fleet (`default_fleet` in my case) where youâ€™ll be adding a Linux host.
3. From the **Add/Update Edge Node** drop-down, select **Docker** to open the **Add Docker Node** modal.
4. Click **Copy script** and dismiss the modal.
- Note: Several parameters provided on this modal can alter the contents of the script. Defaults are fine for this example.
- Alternative: Copy the script [from the docs](https://docs.cribl.io/edge/deploy-running-docker).
5. Note the value of **Edge Nodes** at upper left.

On the Linux host we want to observe with Edge:

1. Paste the script into the shell.
2. Add Â `-v /var/run/appscope:/var/run/appscope` to the script.
- This step is not necessary if you copied the script from the docs.
3. Execute the script â€“ this will run Edge in a Docker container.   

Return to Cribl.Cloud UI to verify that the new Node is present:

1.  The value of **Edge Nodes** should have increased by 1.
2. Select **List View** (and filtering by host if needed) â€“ the new Edge Node should appear in the list.  

At this point, Edge is running in a Docker container and is connected to the Edge Leader.  

### Scope by PID

Still in Edgeâ€™s **List View** tab:

- Click the GUID for the host weâ€™ve just added.
- Click the count of **running processes** at upper left. Now you can observe and interact with a list of processes on this particular Linux Host.

On the Linux host: 

- In the same shell, start a process you want to scope.  For this example, letâ€™s start `top`.  

Back in Edge: 

Within seconds, `top` should appear in the process list. (If you donâ€™t see it, try filtering by Command.) At this point `top` is running but is not yet instrumented by AppScope.

1. Select the `top` command's row to open the **Process: top** drawer.
2. In the **AppScope** tab, select the AppScope **Configuration** we want to use for this process. 
- Start with `A sensible AppScope configuration ...` .  
3. Leave the default **Source **as `in_appscope`.** **
- If you use a different AppScope Source, configure that Source to set **General Settings** > **Optional Settings** > **UNIX socket permissions** to `777`
4. Click **Start monitoring**.  
- Give it a minute ðŸ™‚ 
- You should see green checkmarks in all the Status columns.

Thatâ€™s it!  You just scoped your first process!

Now youâ€™ll want to confirm that Edge is receiving AppScope data for the scoped `top` process.

On the Edge Leader:

- Navigate to **More** > **Sources** and select **AppScope** to open the Source page. 
- Select the row where `ID` is `in_appscope` .
- **Enabled** should be toggled to `Yes`.
- **UNIX domain socket** should be toggled to `Yes`.
- Verify that **Unix socket path** is `/var/run/appscope/appscope.sock`.
- Click the **Live Data tab**, and you should now see events flowing!  Yeah!

**Optional: **Try the other two configurations and see how the scoped data changes. For the config that has payloads enabled, `curl` and `wget` are good choices.

### Scope by Rule

On the Linux host: 

- In your shell, start a process you want to scope.  Again, letâ€™s  run `top`.  

On the Edge Leader:

- Navigate to **More** > **Sources** and select **AppScope** to open the Source page. 
- Select the row where `ID` is `in_appscope` .

In the AppScope Rules tab, under Rules, click **Add Rule** and complete the Rule as follows:

- **Process name**: `top`
- **Process argument**: Skip, because Process name and Process argument are mutually exclusive.
- **AppScope config**: Select the  `A sensible AppScope configuration ...` .  

Click **Save**.

Click **Commit**, provide a commit message, and click **Commit and Deploy**.

Wait for the changes to be deployed to the Edge Node â€“ probably around 30 seconds. 

- Click the **Live Data tab**, and you should now see events flowing!  Yeah! â€¦ but wait â€“Â thereâ€™s more â€¦

Back on the Linux host:

- In your shell, start *another* `top` process to prove that any process matching your Rule gets scoped.
- Click the **Live Data tab**, and you should now see events flowing from two `top` processes â€“Â theyâ€™ll have different PIDs.

This gets to whatâ€™s so powerful about Rules: You can start processes *after* setting things up, and they get scoped.

Now return to Edgeâ€™s **List View** tab â€“Â the **AppScope** column should indicate that both `top` processes are being scoped.

**Optional: **Try the other two configurations and see how the scoped data changes. For the config that has payloads enabled, `curl` and `wget` are good choices.

In real life, this would be the moment to consider creating Routes and Pipelines to send AppScope data to your favorite Destination(s).

#
# AppScope Runtime Configuration
#
# The AppScope library (`libscope.so`) starts with default configs that are
# mimicked here in this file; meaning, run with no config, or with the stock
# version of this config, and the results are the same.
#
# After loading defaults, the library looks for a config in the following
# places in the order shown. The first readable file found is used and the rest
# are ignored. Entries in the config file override the defaults.
# 
#   1. $SCOPE_CONF_PATH
#   2. $SCOPE_HOME/conf/scope.yml
#   3. $SCOPE_HOME/scope.yml
#   4. /etc/scope/scope.yml
#   5. $HOME/conf/scope.yml
#   6. $HOME/scope.yml
#   7. ./conf/scope.yml
#   8. ./scope.yml
#
# Next, SCOPE_* environment variables are used to override corresponding
# entries in the configs. Details are provided below for each setting and
# the corresponding environment variable names.
#
# Finally, if the `cribl > enable` config is true at this point, either from
# the config file or the $SCOPE_CRIBL/$SCOPE_CRIBL_CLOUD environment variable,
# the library forces the following:
#
#   - `metric > transport` is redirected to the `cribl` backend
#   - `metric > enable` is set to true
#   - `metric > format` is set to ndjson
#   - `event > transport` is redirected to the `cribl` backend
#   - `event > enable` is set to true
#   - `libscope > log > level` is set to warn
#   - `libscope > configevent` is set to true
#
# Use the `scope extract` command to get a copy of the default `scope.yml`.
#
# Use the command below to get a stripped down version of this config.
#
#   egrep -v '^ *#.*$' scope.yml | sed '/^$/d' >scope-minimal.yml
# 

# Settings for metrics
#
metric:

  # Enable the metrics backend
  #   Type:     boolean

  # Settings for the format of metric data
  format:

    # Metric format type
    #   Type:     string
    #   Values:   statsd, ndjson

    #   Override: $SCOPE_METRIC_FORMAT
    #
    # When the `cribl` backend is enabled, this is forced to ndjson.
    #

    # Prefix for statsd metrics; ignored if type isn't statsd
    #   Type:     string
    #   Values:   (and string)
    #   Default:  (none)
    #   Override: $SCOPE_STATSD_PREFIX
    #
    statsdprefix:

    # Maximum length of formatted statsd metrics; ignored unless type is statsd
    #   Type:     integer
    #   Values:   (greater than zero)
    #   Default:  512
    #   Override: $SCOPE_STATSD_MAXLEN
    #
    statsdmaxlen: 512

    # Metric verbosity level
    #   Type:     integer
    #   Values:   0-9
    #   Default:  4
    #   Override: $SCOPE_METRIC_VERBOSITY
    #
    # This setting controls two different aspects of the metrics generated by
    # the library: tag cardinality and aggregation. Lower values reduce the
    # verbosity of metric data produced, while higher values increase it.
    #
    # Metrics have at a minimum name, value, and type properties. Optional tags
    # can be added to provide additional detail on the measurement. The library
    # adds expanded Statsd tags depending on the value of this setting as
    # described below. These affect the cardinality of the metrics data.
    #   
    #   0  none
    #   1  adds data and unit
    #   2  adds class and proto
    #   3  adds op
    #   4  adds pid, host, proc, and http_status
    #   5  adds domain and file
    #   6  adds localip, remoteip, localp, port, and remotep
    #   7  adds fd and args
    #   8  adds duration, numops, req_per_sec, req, resp, and protocol
    #
    # The library counts various events and generates metrics for them
    # periodically. The verbosity config disables this metric aggregation for
    # groups of events. When disabled, events that would normally have been
    # summarized in an aggregate metric are instead sent as individual metrics
    # with a count of 1 and additional details from the event added, e.g.,
    # operation, filename, process, error code, etc.
    #
    #   0-4 full metric aggregation
    #   5   disable error metric aggregation
    #   6   disable filesystem open/close and DNS metric aggregation
    #   7   disable filesystem stat and network connect metric aggregation
    #   8   disable filesystem seek metric aggregation
    #   9   disable filesystem read/write and network send/recv metric aggregation
    #

# Tags for events and metrics
#
tags:
  # `key: value` entries here become fields in generated events and metrics.
  #
  # Simple $EXAMPLE variables in the value will be replaced with the
  # corresponding environment variable values. The regex looks for dollar signs
  # followed by one or more alphanumeric or underscore characters. If the
  # corresponding environment variable is not set, the variable is left in the
  # value.
  #
  # Tags can also be added with environment variables prefixed with SCOPE_TAG_.
  # For example, SCOPE_TAG_service=eg is equivalent to the "service" example
  # below. The value of the environment variable may contain other variables
  # as described above too; i.e. SCOPE_TAG_user=\$USER.
  #
  #user: $USER

# Protocol detection and handling
#
protocol:
  # Entries in this list define protocols that AppScope should detect in network
  # payloads and how to handle matches. The first packet seen on a channel is
  # checked against the regular expression in each entry in the order they
  # appear in this file. When one matches, later entries are skipped.
  #
  # Entries have the following properties:
  #
  #   name     String protocol name used in protocol-detect events and payload
  #            headers sent to LogStream (required)
  #   regex    The regular expression to use (required)
  #   binary   Boolean indicating whether the regex should be applied to a
  #            hex-string version of the payload instead of the binary payload
  #            (default: false)
  #   len      The number of bytes to convert to hex when `binary` is true
  #            (default: 256)
  #   detect   Boolean indicating whether protocol-detect events should be
  #            generated (default: true)
  #   payload  Boolean indicating whether payload-processing should be enabled
  #            for matching streams (default: false)
  #
  # When payloads are enabled globally (`payload > enable`), the payload
  # options here are ignored.
  #
  # Warning: The `name` value is currently inserted into the JSON header for
  # payloads sent to LogStream so it cannot contain double quotes or
  # back-slashes without breaking the JSON. It needs to be kept fairly short
  # too so the header doesn't exceed the 1k limit. If this becomes a problem,
  # we'll consider adding logging and validation.
  #

  # Example for the plain-text Redis protocol using the default detect and
  # payload settings
  #
  #- name: Redis
  #  regex: "^[*]\\d+|^[+]\\w+|^[$]\\d+"

  # Example for the MongoDB protocol showing how to detect a binary protocol
  #
  #- name: Mongo
  #  regex: "^240100000000000000000000d407"
  #  binary: true
  #  len: 14

  # AppScope uses an internally defined protocol detector for HTTP like the
  # example below by default.
  #
  # Uncomment this and adjust as needed to override the defaults.
  #
  #- name: HTTP
  #  regex: " HTTP\\/1\\.[0-2]|PRI \\* HTTP\\/2\\.0\r\n\r\nSM\r\n\r\n"

  # AppScope uses another internally defined protocol detector for SSL/TLS like
  # the example below by default.
  #
  # Uncomment this entry to override the regex details or to set detect to
  # false. The payload setting here is never used. AppScope never sends
  # encrypted payloads to disk or to LogStream.
  #
  #- name: TLS
  #  regex: "^(?:(?:16030[0-3].{4})|(?:8[0-9a-fA-F]{3}01))"
  #  binary: true
  #  len: 5

# Custom configs
#
custom:
  # Entries here represent overrides of the settings defined above for scoped
  # processes that match a set of filters. Each has a name and `filter` and
  # `config` entries as shown below.
  #
  #   name:
  #     filter:
  #       ...
  #     config:
  #       ...
  #
  # Entries under `filter` are used to match aspects of a scoped process. There
  # must be at least one of them and all of them must match for the filter to
  # succeed. The following filters are supported.
  #
  #   procname: string
  #
  #     Matches if the given string value matches the basename of the scoped
  #     process.
  #
  #   arg: string
  #
  #     Matches if the given string value appears and a substring anywhere in
  #     the scoped process's full command line including an options and
  #     arguments.
  #
  #   hostname: string
  #
  #     Matches if the given string value matches the hostname of the machine
  #     where the scoped process is running.
  #     
  #   username: string
  #
  #     Matches if the given string value matches the username for the scoped
  #     process's UID.
  #     
  #   env: string
  #
  #     The string value is the name of an environment variable alone (i.e.
  #     "FOO") or with a value (i.e. "FOO=bar"). The filter matches if the
  #     environment variable is set and, in the later case, the value matches.
  #
  #   ancestor: string
  #
  #     Matches if given string matches the basename of the scoped process's
  #     parent, parent's parent, etc.
  #
  # The `config` section specifies the settings that should be overridden when
  # the filter matches. Entries under `config` use the same schema as the
  # top-level entries (without `custom`).
  #
  
  # Increase metric verbosity for processes owned by the "eg" user and running
  # on the "eg1" host.
  #
  #example:
  #  filter:
  #    username: eg
  #    hostname: eg1
  #  config:
  #    metric:
  #      format:
  #        verbosity: 7
  #    tags:
  #      service: eg

  # Enable the Cribl/Logstream destination for Nginx processes. Both this entry
  # and the `example` entry above would apply if both filters match so the
  # service tag here would override the one above.
  #
  #nginx:
  #  filter:
  #    procname: nginx
  #  config:
  #    tags:
  #      service: nginx
  #    cribl:
  #      enable: true
  #      transport:
  #        type: tcp
  #        host: in.my-instance.logstream.cribl.cloud

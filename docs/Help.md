OVERVIEW:
The Scope library supports extraction of data from within applications.
As a general rule, applications consist of one or more processes.
The Scope library can be loaded into any process as the
process starts.
The primary way to define which processes include the Scope library
is by exporting the environment variable LD_PRELOAD, which is set to point
to the path name of the Scope library. E.g.: 
export LD_PRELOAD=./libscope.so

Scope emits data as metrics and/or events.
Scope is fully configurable by means of a configuration file (scope.yml)
and/or environment variables.

Metrics are emitted in StatsD format, over a configurable link. By default,
metrics are sent over a UDP socket using localhost and port 8125.

Events are emitted in JSON format over a configurable link. By default,
events are sent over a TCP socket using localhost and port 9109.

Scope logs to a configurable destination, at a configurable
verbosity level. The default verbosity setting is level 4, and the
default destination is the file `/tmp/scope.log`.

```
CONFIGURATION:
Configuration File:
    A YAML config file (named scope.yml) enables control of all available
    settings. The config file is optional. Environment variables take
    precedence over settings in a config file.

Config File Resolution
    If the SCOPE_CONF_PATH env variable is defined, and points to a
    file that can be opened, it will use this as the config file.
    Otherwise, AppScope searches for the config file in this priority
    order, using the first one it finds:

        $SCOPE_HOME/conf/scope.yml
        $SCOPE_HOME/scope.yml
        /etc/scope/scope.yml
        ~/conf/scope.yml
        ~/scope.yml
        ./conf/scope.yml
        ./scope.yml

    SCOPE_CRIBL_TLS_CA_CERT_PATH

    SCOPE_CONFIG_EVENT
        Sends a single process-identifying event, when a transport
        connection is established.  true,false  Default is true.
    CRIBL_HOME
        Defines the prefix to the path where the library 
        will installed to, or retrieved from.

Dynamic Configuration:
    Dynamic Configuration allows configuration settings to be
    changed on the fly after process start time. At every
    SCOPE_SUMMARY_PERIOD, the library looks in SCOPE_CMD_DIR to
    see if a file scope.<pid> exists. If it exists, the library processes
    every line, looking for environment variable–style commands
    (e.g., SCOPE_CMD_DBG_PATH=/tmp/outfile.txt). The library changes the
    configuration to match the new settings, and deletes the
    scope.<pid> file when it's complete.

    While every environment variable defined here can be changed via
    Dynamic Configuration, there are a few environment variable-style
    commands that are only accepted during Dynamic Configuration.
    These will be ignored if specified as actual environment variables.
    They are listed here:
        SCOPE_CMD_ATTACH
            Flag that controls whether interposed functions are
            processed by AppScope (true), or not (false).
        SCOPE_CMD_DBG_PATH
            Causes AppScope to write debug information to the
            specified file path. Absolute paths are recommended.
        SCOPE_CONF_RELOAD
            Causes AppScope to reload its configuration file. If
            the value is \"true\", it is reloaded according to the
            Config File Resolution above. If any other value is
            specified, it is handled like SCOPE_CONF_PATH, but without
            the \"Used only at start time\" limitation.

Certificate Authority Resolution
    If SCOPE_*_TLS_ENABLE and SCOPE_*_TLS_VALIDATE_SERVER are true then
    AppScope performs TLS server validation. For this to be successful
    a CA certificate must be found that can authenticate the certificate
    the server provides during the TLS handshake process.
    If SCOPE_*_TLS_CA_CERT_PATH is set, AppScope will use this file path
    which is expected to contain CA certificates in PEM format. If this
    env variable is an empty string or not set, AppScope searches for a
    usable root CA file on the local filesystem, using the first one
    found from this list:

        /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
        /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt
        /etc/ssl/ca-bundle.pem
        /etc/pki/tls/cacert.pem
        /etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted/pem/tls-ca-bundle.pem
        /etc/ssl/cert.pem

METRICS:
Metrics can be enabled or disabled with a single config element
(metric: enable: true|false). Specific types of metrics, and specific 
field content, are managed with a Metric Verbosity setting.

Metric Verbosity
    Controls two different aspects of metric output – 
    Tag Cardinality and Summarization.

    Tag Cardinality
        0   No expanded StatsD tags
        1   adds 'data', 'unit'
        2   adds 'class', 'proto'
        3   adds 'op'
        4   adds 'pid', 'host', 'proc', 'http_status'
        5   adds 'domain', 'file'
        6   adds 'localip', 'remoteip', 'localp', 'port', 'remotep'
        7   adds 'fd', 'args'
        8   adds 'duration','numops','req_per_sec','req','resp','protocol'

    Summarization
        0-4 has full event summarization
        5   turns off 'error'
        6   turns off 'filesystem open/close' and 'dns'
        7   turns off 'filesystem stat' and 'network connect'
        8   turns off 'filesystem seek'
        9   turns off 'filesystem read/write' and 'network send/receive'

The http.status metric is emitted when the http watch type has been
enabled as an event. The http.status metric is not controlled with
summarization settings.

EVENTS:
All events can be enabled or disabled with a single config element
(event: enable: true|false). Unlike metrics, event content is not 
managed with verbosity settings. Instead, you use regex filters that 
manage which field types and field values to include.

 Events are organized as 7 watch types: 
 1) File Content. Provide a pathname, and all data written to the file
    will be organized in JSON format and emitted over the event channel.
 2) Console Output. Select stdin and/or stdout, and all data written to
    these endpoints will be formatted in JSON and emitted over the event
    channel.
 3) Metrics. Event metrics provide the greatest level of detail from
    libscope. Events are created for every read, write, send, receive,
    open, close, and connect. These raw events are configured with regex
    filters to manage which event, which specific fields within an event,
    and which value patterns within a field to include.
 4) HTTP Headers. HTTP headers are extracted, formatted in JSON, and
    emitted over the event channel. Three types of events are created
    for HTTP headers: 1) HTTP request events, 2) HTTP response events,
    and 3) a metric event corresponding to the request and response
    sequence. A response event includes the corresponding request,
    status and duration fields. An HTTP metric event provides fields
    describing bytes received, requests per second, duration, and status.
    Any header defined as X-appscope (case insensitive) will be emitted.
    User defined headers are extracted by using the headers field.
    The headers field is a regular expression.
 5) File System. Events are formatted in JSON for each file system open,
    including file name, permissions, and cgroup. Events for file system
    close add a summary of the number of bytes read and written, the
    total number of read and write operations, and the total duration
    of read and write operations. The specific function performing open
    and close is reported as well.
 6) Network. Events are formatted in JSON for network connections and 
    corresponding disconnects, including type of protocol used, and 
    local and peer IP:port. Events for network disconnect add a summary
    of the number of bytes sent and received, and the duration of the
    sends and receives while the connection was active. The reason
    (source) for disconnect is provided as local or remote. 
 7) DNS. Events are formatted in JSON for DNS requests and responses.
    The event provides the domain name being resolved. On DNS response,
    the event provides the duration of the DNS operation.

PROTOCOL DETECTION:
Scope can detect any defined network protocol. You provide protocol
definitions in the \"protocol\" section of the config file. You describe 
protocol specifics in one or more regex definitions. PCRE2 regular 
expressions are supported. The stock scope.yml file for examples.

Scope detects binary and string protocols. Detection events, 
formatted in JSON, are emitted over the event channel unless the \"detect\"
property is set to \"false\".

PAYLOAD EXTRACTION:
When enabled, libscope extracts payload data from network operations.
Payloads are emitted in binary. No formatting is applied to the data.
Payloads are emitted to either a local file or the LogStream channel.
Configuration elements for libscope support defining a path for payload
data.
```

#
# AppScope Runtime Configuration
#
# The AppScope library (`libscope.so`) starts with default configs that are
# mimicked here in this file; meaning, run with no config, or with the stock
# version of this config, and the results are the same.
#
# After loading defaults, the library looks for a config in the following
# places in the order shown. The first readable file found is used and the rest
# are ignored. Entries in the config file override the defaults.
# 
#   1. $SCOPE_CONF_PATH
#   2. $SCOPE_HOME/conf/scope.yml
#   3. $SCOPE_HOME/scope.yml
#   4. /etc/scope/scope.yml
#   5. $HOME/conf/scope.yml
#   6. $HOME/scope.yml
#   7. ./conf/scope.yml
#   8. ./scope.yml
#
# Next, SCOPE_* environment variables are used to override corresponding
# entries in the configs. Details are provided below for each setting and
# the corresponding environment variable names.
#
# Finally, if the `cribl > enable` config is true at this point, either from
# the config file or the $SCOPE_CRIBL/$SCOPE_CRIBL_CLOUD environment variable,
# the library forces the following:
#
#   - `metric > transport` is redirected to the `cribl` backend
#   - `metric > enable` is set to true
#   - `metric > format` is set to ndjson
#   - `event > transport` is redirected to the `cribl` backend
#   - `event > enable` is set to true
#   - `event > watch[]` with `name: http` is disabled
#   - `libscope > log > level` is set to warn
#   - `libscope > configevent` is set to true
#
# Use the `scope extract` command to get a copy of the default `scope.yml`.
#
# Use the command below to get a stripped down version of this config.
#
#   egrep -v '^ *#.*$' scope.yml | sed '/^$/d' >scope-minimal.yml
# 

# Settings for metrics
#
metric:

  # Enable the metrics backend
  #   Type:     boolean
  #   Values:   true, false
  #   Default:  true
  #   Override: $SCOPE_METRIC_ENABLE
  #
  #
  enable: true

  # Settings for the format of metric data
  format:

    # Metric format type
    #   Type:     string
    #   Values:   statsd, ndjson
    #   Default:  statsd
    #   Override: $SCOPE_METRIC_FORMAT
    #
    # When the `cribl` backend is enabled, this is forced to ndjson.
    #
    type: statsd

    # Prefix for statsd metrics; ignored if type isn't statsd
    #   Type:     string
    #   Values:   (and string)
    #   Default:  (none)
    #   Override: $SCOPE_STATSD_PREFIX
    #
    statsdprefix:

    # Maximum length of formatted statsd metrics; ignored unless type is statsd
    #   Type:     integer
    #   Values:   (greater than zero)
    #   Default:  512
    #   Override: $SCOPE_STATSD_MAXLEN
    #
    statsdmaxlen: 512

    # Metric verbosity level
    #   Type:     integer
    #   Values:   0-9
    #   Default:  4
    #   Override: $SCOPE_METRIC_VERBOSITY
    #
    # This setting controls two different aspects of the metrics generated by
    # the library: tag cardinality and aggregation. Lower values reduce the
    # verbosity of metric data produced, while higher values increase it.
    #
    # Metrics have at a minimum name, value, and type properties. Optional tags
    # can be added to provide additional detail on the measurement. The library
    # adds expanded Statsd tags depending on the value of this setting as
    # described below. These affect the cardinality of the metrics data.
    #   
    #   0  none
    #   1  adds data and unit
    #   2  adds class and proto
    #   3  adds op
    #   4  adds pid, host, proc, and http_status
    #   5  adds domain and file
    #   6  adds localip, remoteip, localp, port, and remotep
    #   7  adds fd and args
    #   8  adds duration, numops, req_per_sec, req, resp, and protocol
    #
    # The library counts various events and generates metrics for them
    # periodically. The verbosity config disables this metric aggregation for
    # groups of events. When disabled, events that would normally have been
    # summarized in an aggregate metric are instead sent as individual metrics
    # with a count of 1 and additional details from the event added, e.g.,
    # operation, filename, process, error code, etc.
    #
    #   0-4 full metric aggregation
    #   5   disable error metric aggregation
    #   6   disable filesystem open/close and DNS metric aggregation
    #   7   disable filesystem stat and network connect metric aggregation
    #   8   disable filesystem seek metric aggregation
    #   9   disable filesystem read/write and network send/recv metric aggregation
    #
    verbosity : 4

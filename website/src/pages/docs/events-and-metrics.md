# Events and Metrics in AppScope {#events-and-metrics}

When AppScope has [interposed a function](/docs/how-works), and then the application being scoped executes that function, AppScope can emit events and metrics. Both events and metrics follow patterns that are rigorously defined in validatable [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/), and documented in the [Schema Reference](/docs/schema-reference).

AppScope outputs metrics either in [StatsD](https://github.com/statsd/statsd) format or in equivalent JSON. AppScope can also watch for and intercept StatsD-formatted metrics being emitted by a scoped application.

## What Events Do {#events}

Events describe the action performed by the interposed function. For example, a `net.open` event could tell you that a network connection was established by Firefox, from the local IP/port `172.16.198.210:54388` to the remote IP/port `34.107.221.82:80`, using HTTP over TCP.

### The process‑start message {#process-start-message}

If `configevent` is set to `true`, AppScope sends a process‑start message upon establishing a new connection. This message – the [start.msg](schema-reference#eventstartmsg) event – reports the configs in effect at the time. The `start.msg.info.process.libscopever` element reports the version of AppScope that's being used.

The process‑start message also includes four distinct identifiers:
  - **UUID** with key `uuid` and a value in [canonical UUID form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier). UUID is a universally-unique process identifier, meaning that no two processes will ever have the same UUID value on the same machine.
  - **Machine ID** with key `machine_id` and a value that AppScope obtains from `/etc/machine-id`. The machine ID uniquely identifies the host, as described in the [man page](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/machine-id.5.html). When `/etc/machine-id` is not available (e.g., in Alpine, or in a container), AppScope generates the machine ID using a repeatable MD5 hash of the host's first MAC address. Two containers on the same host can have the same machine ID.
  - **Process ID**, with key `pid` and a value that is always unique at any given time, but that the machine can reuse for different processes at different times.
  - **ID**, with key `id` and a value that concatenates (and may truncate) the scoped app's hostname, procname, and command. This value is not guaranteed to be unique.

By itself, the **UUID** process ID is unique for a given machine. In principle, **UUID** and **Machine ID** together constitute a tuple ID that is unique across all machine namespaces.

## What Metrics Do {#metrics}

Metrics can do any of three things:
* When verbosity is set to lower values, metrics summarize aspects of the action performed by the interposed function, for a reporting period that defaults to 10 seconds. (See the `Metric verbosity level` section of the [config file](/docs/config-file).) For example, a `fs.read` metric could tell you that an `httpd` process has read a total of 320967 bytes from the filesystem, having performed multiple reads over a 10-second period.
* When verbosity is set to higher values, metrics provide details about the action performed by the interposed function in real time. For example, an `fs.read` metric could tell you that an `httpd` process has done one read of 8245 bytes from one specific file, `/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf`.
* When the metric name begins with `proc`, metrics periodically report information about resource usage at a point in time. For example, a `proc.mem` metric could tell you that `httpd` is currently using 62,123 KB of memory.

The table below gives the gory details:

| Verbosity Level | Cardinality (dimensions) | Aggregate Error Metrics? | Aggregate DNS Metrics? | Filesystem Metrics to Aggregate | Network Metrics to Aggregate |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| 0 | none | yes | yes | all | all |
| 1 | `data` and `unit` | yes | yes | all | all |
| 2 | same as 1, plus `class` and `proto` | yes | yes | all | all |
| 3 | same as 2, plus `op` | yes | yes | all | all |
| 4 | same as 3, plus `pid`, `host`, `proc`, and `http_status` | yes | yes | all | all |
| 5 | same as 4, plus `domain` and `file` | no | yes | all | all |
| 6 | same as 5, plus `localip`, `remoteip`, `localp`, `port`, and `remotep` | no | no | all but `open`/`close` | all |
| 7 | same as 6, plus `fd` and `args` | no | no | all but `open`/`close` and `stat` | all but `connect` |
| 8 | same as 7, plus `duration`, `numops`, `req_per_sec`, `req`, `resp`, and `protocol` | no | no | all but `open`/`close`, `stat`, and `seek` | same as 7 |
| 9 | same as 8 | no | no | all but `open`/`close`, `stat`, `seek`, and `read`/`write` | all but `connect` and `send`/`recv` |
  
### How to Interpret Metrics {#interpret-metrics}

To interpret a given metric, you must consider its type. There are four possibilities:  

| Metric Type | Value Description |
|-------------|-------------------|
| `gauge` | A numeric value that can increase or decrease over time – like a temperature or pressure gauge. |
| `counter` | A cumulative numeric value – it can only increase over time. |
| `timer` | Measures how long a given event type takes (duration). |
| `histogram` | A StatsD histogram distributes sampled observations into buckets. With AppScope, we encounter histograms only in the special case where AppScope intercepts StatsD-formatted metrics whose type is `histogram`. AppScope merely preserves that labeling: we assume that the scoped application has already aggregated the values into buckets. |

For example, `proc.fd` is a `gauge` that indicates how many files were open at one point in time. If we're scoping `top`, that's typically fewer than 10. By contrast, `fs.open` is a `count` that increments every time a file is opened. When scoping `top` over a reporting period of 10 seconds, you could see values in the hundreds or thousands.

It's important to take into account whether the application or command you are scoping is short-lived or longer-lasting. For commands that complete very quickly, a `gauge` will report the value at the moment that AppScope exits the process.

By default, all classes of events and metrics are turned on – but you can turn any class of metric or event data on or off individually. To do this, include or omit the desired watch type(s) from the `metric > watch[*]` array and/or the `event > watch[*]` array in the [config file](/docs/config-file). Environment variables can achieve the same effect. For example, the environment variable to turn off metrics of watch type `statsd` would be `SCOPE_METRIC_STATSD=false`. To turn on events of watch type `logfile`, you'd use `SCOPE_EVENT_LOGFILE=true`.

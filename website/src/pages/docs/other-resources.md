The deep integration of AppScope 1.4.0 and Cribl Edge 4.2 offers optimal power and convenience in many use cases; but since those versions are the newest available, the resources in this section all describe earlier versions of AppScope.

Keeping that caveat in mind, you should find abundant useful information in the resources listed here.

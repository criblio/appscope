# AppScope Design Docs

We keep developer-specific docs here. Before delving in, you should be familiar already with:

- The main [README](../README.md) at the top level of this project
- The user docs on the [AppScope website](https://appscope.dev/docs/)

Once you're past those, take a look at these.

- [RELEASE](./RELEASE.md) - Release Process
- [BUILD](./BUILD.md) - Build System
- [INTEGRATION](../test/integration/README.md) - Integration Testing

> We will be adding more docs over time.
